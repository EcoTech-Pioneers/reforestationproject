# Forest Revive

## Overview
Deforestation is one of the major concerns threatening climate sustainability in Kenya. In 2010, Kenya had 3.18 Mha of natural forest, extending over 5.7% of its land area. In 2022, it lost 6.29 kha of natural forest, equivalent to 3.29 Mt of COâ‚‚ emissions (Global Forest Watch, 2022). This program is developed based on the principle that it is a shared responsibility by Kenyan community members to come together and recover our forest cover. Thus, this project focuses on the development of a program that will educate communities on the issue of deforestation, inform them on the current efforts to reforest Kenya, and mobilize them to participate in these efforts.
